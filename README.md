### Hey, I'm Elias 👋  
I'm a data-driven problem solver studying **Finance & Economics** at the University of Oregon and an incoming **Payments Risk Analyst** at Coinbase. My work focuses on using Python and SQL to build models that detect fraud, quantify risk, and improve decision-making at scale.

I’ve built survival and random-forest models for time-to-compromise prediction, automated fraud alerts in Superset, and pitched vendor drift analyses that shaped hundreds of thousands in transaction volume. Outside of Coinbase, I apply econometrics and data-science tools to financial markets and behavioral data, wherever there’s signal to uncover.

**Languages & Tools:** Python, R, SQL, pandas, scikit-learn, lifelines, random-forest 
**Core Skills:** Risk modeling · Fraud analytics · Econometrics · Data visualization · Experiment design  

💡 Currently exploring: ML model monitoring, survival-time prediction, and open-source finance analytics
