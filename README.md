### Hey, I'm Elias ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a data-driven problem solver studying **Finance & Economics** at the University of Oregon and working in **Payments Risk** at Coinbase. My work focuses on using Python and R to build models that detect fraud, quantify risk, and improve decision-making at scale.

Iâ€™ve built survival and random-forest models for time-to-compromise prediction, automated fraud alerts, and vendor drift analyses that shaped millions in transaction volume. Outside of Coinbase, I apply econometrics and data-science tools to financial markets and behavioral data â€” wherever thereâ€™s signal to uncover.

**Languages & Tools:** Python, R, SQL, pandas, scikit-learn, lifelines, dplyr, Quarto, Git  
**Core Skills:** Risk modeling Â· Fraud analytics Â· Econometrics Â· Data visualization Â· Experiment design  

ðŸ’¡ Currently exploring: ML model monitoring, survival-time prediction, and open-source finance analytics
